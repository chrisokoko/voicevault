<div class="central-question">‚ùì What type of love do I deserve and how do I recognize it when I find it?</div>
<div class="central-question">‚ö° The contradiction between giving deeply while receiving little, knowing I'm a pleaser yet struggling to set boundaries</div>

<div class="central-question">‚ùì How do I establish a trustworthy relationship with my own emotional self?</div>
<div class="central-question">‚ö° The paradox of being both the protector and the one needing protection within oneself</div>
<div class="summary">True self-care begins with making an explicit promise of safety and non-abandonment to one's own heart. This reframes the relationship with our emotional self as requiring the same conscious commitment we would offer to a beloved other.</div>
</div>
<div class="memo">
<div class="memo-title">üìù ‚ÄéAudio Message from Laura Riley</div>
<div class="central-question">‚ùì How do we move toward love and connection despite the protective mechanisms of fear?</div>

</div>
<div class="memo">
<div class="memo-title">üìù Bengal Cir 4</div>
<div class="central-question">‚ùì How do we offer ourselves the tenderness and care we most deeply need?</div>
<div class="central-question">‚ö° The paradox between our adult complexity and our inner child's need for simple, repeated comfort</div>
<div class="summary">True healing happens when we speak directly to our most tender parts with simple, repeated acknowledgment. The profound wisdom lies not in complexity but in the gentle mantra offered to our vulnerable inner heart.</div>
</div>
<div class="memo">
<div class="memo-title">üìù SE Second Ave</div>

<div class="central-question">‚ö° The desire for worthiness and connection versus the impulse to numb and escape through destructive behaviors</div>
<div class="summary">A raw moment of recognizing how the body holds emotional truth about validation-seeking and numbing patterns. The physical sensations reveal what the mind struggles to process - the desperate need to feel chosen and worthy driving destructive coping behaviors.</div>
</div>
<div class="memo">
<div class="memo-title">üìù Song: Dance with me sample</div>
<div class="central-question">‚ùì How do we navigate the vulnerability of authentic connection and invitation?</div>
<div class="central-question">‚ö° The risk between opening oneself to deep connection versus protecting against potential rejection</div>

<div class="central-question">‚ùì What untold stories from our parents hold irreplaceable wisdom that will be lost forever if we don't actively seek them out?</div>
<div class="central-question">‚ö° The urgency of capturing disappearing stories versus the assumption that we already know our parents' experiences</div>
<div class="summary">This insight recognizes that even our closest relationships contain unexplored depths - there's always one more story our parents haven't shared that could change everything. It transforms story-gathering from passive assumption to active, urgent practice before these irreplaceable narratives are lost forever.</div>
</div>
<div class="memo">
<div class="memo-title">üìù University of Oregon Portland 5</div>
<div class="central-question">‚ùì How do we honor and preserve the irreplaceable stories of those we've lost?</div>
<div class="central-question">‚ö° The painful recognition of lost opportunity versus the sacred responsibility to preserve what remains</div>
<div class="summary">The author transforms personal regret about lost conversations with their grandmother into a universal call to preserve and share the stories of our elders before they disappear forever. This shifts grief from passive suffering into active cultural stewardship.</div>

<div class="memo">
<div class="memo-title">üìù University of Oregon Portland 2</div>
<div class="central-question">‚ùì How do we bridge the gap between generations through the stories our mothers carry?</div>
<div class="central-question">‚ö° The longing to know our mothers as full human beings versus the limited stories we actually receive</div>
<div class="summary">Stories serve as bridges between generations, but we must ask intentional questions to access the deeper narratives that reveal our mothers as complete human beings. The quality of our questions determines the depth of intergenerational connection and understanding we can achieve.</div>
</div>
<div class="memo">
<div class="memo-title">üìù University of Oregon Portland 3</div>
<div class="central-question">‚ùì What profound wisdom and experience dies with our loved ones when their stories remain untold?</div>
<div class="central-question">‚ö° The simultaneous presence and absence of stories that exist but remain unshared</div>
<div class="summary">A single question about untold stories can carry more weight than any answer, revealing how silence itself becomes a container for profound meaning. The recognition that our loved ones carry entire worlds of unshared experience points to both loss and the urgent beauty of story-sharing while we can.</div>

<div class="summary">What if we could hear our ancestors tell their own stories in their own voices, sharing intimate experiences of love, growth, and life lessons? This vision imagines technology enabling direct access to humanity's most important personal narratives across generations.</div>
</div>
<div class="memo">
<div class="memo-title">üìù Thoughts on 7 generations </div>

<div class="central-question">‚ö° The need to honor all generations versus human cognitive limitations in comprehending infinity</div>
<div class="summary">The 'seven generations' principle in ancestral traditions isn't the actual scope of our responsibility - it's a cognitive accommodation that helps humans grasp infinite intergenerational connection. Sacred numbers often serve as training wheels for truths too vast for ordinary comprehension.</div>

<div class="central-question">‚ö° The contradiction between selling treatments/spaces versus selling human connection</div>
<div class="summary">The key to wellness business success isn't showcasing beautiful spaces or treatments during tours - it's getting people physically present and connecting them with spectacular facilitators. Human connection, not facility features, drives conversion.</div>

<div class="central-question">‚ö° The contradiction between traditional sales approaches (pitch first) and what actually builds trust (educate first)</div>
<div class="summary">The best business partners reveal themselves in the first two minutes by making you curious about their knowledge rather than impressed by their credentials. True expertise manifests as education-first approaches that build trust through demonstrated competence rather than traditional sales pitches.</div>

<div class="central-question">‚ö° The need to provide structure and guidance versus the imperative to preserve individual authenticity and passion</div>

<div class="central-question">‚ö° The inevitable fade of peak experiences versus the desire for sustained community connection</div>
<div class="summary">Peak experiences need intentional aftercare systems that acknowledge the vulnerable 'morning after' feeling and provide ongoing reminders that community support continues.
