I think the philosophy which has been written, the dish, I think is clarified here, is that we can have direct connection with something beyond us, that we can speak to plants, that we can use, the elements as the great teachers, and that through, through the practice of, many practices, but one of them is plant medicines, through the practice of plant medicines, in rituals, ceremonies, rights of passage, that we can cultivate a direct connection with, our ancestors, with plants, with animals, with the elements that we can speak to the moon, we can speak to the fire, and we are organizing ourselves around that truth. In the tools, the path way is open, question, question, open, the plant medicine, search, through experimentation, through story, through community, and this process of searching is a process of, of, of, of, playing, finding what we want, this is actually the chief's way, this archetype, this archetypal pattern, is the chief's way, as written by the, the, the, the chief in the fool, and, it's, and that's, that's the path actually, that's, when we think about a, a step to program, this is the step to program, is the chief's way, and we have, we're always, we're always walking that path, it's a circular path, but to have, someone who has, has gone through the stages, or at least has gone, is, at least the stage ahead of you, to be, your counsel, to be your sponsor, to acknowledge that we are all practicing, holding counsel, that we're all elders. And that's, that's the path.
