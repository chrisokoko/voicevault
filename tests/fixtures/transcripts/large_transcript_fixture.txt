Now that I've gotten to sit with it for about a week, I want to revisit the 12-month growth strategy. And, you know, before I even get in to answering the questions in this document, I want to ground it into my experience working with almost two dozen startups in the health and wellness space across in-house and agency roles. And I want to communicate some of the wisdom that I carry in seeing what successful companies do and how successful companies, successful CEOs and leaders of companies approach things. And it all revolves around money in kind of two ways. The first is in how we are monetized by others and the second is in how we monetize ourselves. So, let's break that down. We are monetized by others when we are not in control of our fate. So, if we're creating a company that is not sustainable, that's not profitable, then we have to bring in outside money. Or we have to make compromises in our decision making. And we have to start to prioritize what's going to actually make us money so that we don't quite a business versus how can we serve our mission and our customers the best? How can we create value which then flows back to us? That's the question. That's where we want to be is to be able to answer those types of questions. And what can happen is if we take on money from investors, they can force our hand to monetize before we're ready or they can shape the soul of our company in ways that don't resonate with our mission and who we're trying to serve. The other way that we can monetize ourselves is by operating from that place of fear. Oh, we're afraid of going out of business so we're going to make decisions that optimize for making money versus optimize for serving our customers and our mission. So, in both of those cases it's really important to get to a place of sustainability, of profitability as soon as possible. And this is something that I've experienced personally in building the womb, my community co-living and bathhouse project. And I had limite

d funds. I spent, I was strategic around why I bought the property I did because I know that I could run both a co-living business and a bathhouse business. I really wanted to do the bathhouse business. And the community was the hedge. And it was a good hedge because I ended up running out of money for the bathhouse. The utility costs I had never done a big real estate project before. There was unknown unknowns. One of them was utility costs. And utilities being ended up being way more than I could afford. So we got a really beautiful sauna, some rustic old cold plunge tubs, but no hot tub, no beautiful landscaping or lights or, you know, the true vision of what I wanted didn't manifest. And yet it's still a beautiful bathhouse, just not bringing in money as I had hoped it would. But the co-living community is. And it was very important to get to that place of profitability so that there's breathing room, so that I'm not bleeding money into this project every month. So with that, I just want to, I want to preface with that because I've seen companies focus on the wrong things too early, specifically focusing on building brand or building community before building profitability. And at this stage of company, this is my niche. I know that this stage and this niche is what I've been working with for the entirety of my career. And, you know, people like Robbie Bent of other ship, they, you know, he wasn't focused on building a really sexy brand. He was focused on solving people's problems, on understanding how to get people into a space and building partnerships to do that. And ultimately got to a place of, you know, he launched in his backyard. He launched in his backyard, figured out how to get people excited about it. Then he built a $200,000 concept in his garage and then got that to profitability and then put his own, some of his own money into doing the first concept. He got that to incredible profitability and then raised money to it to scale. Right? So he's alwa

ys been about profitability and owning his future. Versus, I've seen someone like a company like Parable was a brain supplement company. They also raised $2 million. They raised $2 million from PepsiCo for their seed round. And they spent it on doing a, you know, $100,000 plus research study with a double-blind experience to try to prove the effectiveness of this, of their brain supplement. And they spent a bunch of money on hiring a really sick brand agency so that they had a really sexy landing page. And then they hired me, you know, one of the most expensive, you know, me, a growth, a growth ahead of growth from one of the most expensive agencies, Winston, Francois, to lead their growth. But they weren't ever focused on unit economics. They weren't focused on solving problems. They were focused on trying to be a sexy brand and be sexy founders and be on, you know, get cover pieces. And they went out of business because they weren't solving a real problem. So that's just, you know, the tale of two stories. And at a company like Odyssey, really, I think we first need to look at who we're serving, where are the current customers at, and why are they coming to Odyssey right now. And we know that there's retirees, that there are business leaders, and that there are healthcare providers. And those are all very different customer personas. And they have different needs. And so the first piece is just getting clear on who are the personas that we're reaching. And I have some examples of what do these personas look like? What are the pain points? How do they behave? What are the questions that they have at different stages of the buyer's journey? And this buyer's journey is one of the core pieces of how we reach people. Because the buyer's journey is, it dictates really the persona and where they're at in the buyer's journey, that dictates the messages that we put out, the content that we put out. So if we wanted to go with this persona at this stage, you know, to get peo

ple into this stage, then we would be putting out content that answers, you know, these types of questions. It'd be content like this. That's showing up in these types of actions. So that's the first piece is getting clear on the persona and where we're targeting in the buyer's journey. The second piece is then understanding. How do we get to profitability? How do we get to freedom as soon as possible? Because once we're profitable, we are not beholden to anyone else. We can make our own decisions. We're free to do what is best for our community and for our mission. So that really is the priority that I see is getting to profitability. And I would like to do that as soon as possible and that's going to dictate what channel we choose first. So we already know that Google is the channel that's providing the most leads and the most clients. And that would be the first channel to prioritize is that's going to go at the top of this list because we know it's working. And the easiest way to get to profitability is going to be to test what's working, to lean into what's already working. On the Google side right now, there's a lot of ads that are targeting bottom of funnel direct response, Silicide Bin, Retreats. So we want to first use what's already working in that place and make it work better. So that's formalizing the lead process, the lead response process that's testing the offer, testing landing pages. into what's already working. So on the Google side right now, there's a lot of ad that are targeting bottom of funnel direct response. Silicide bin retreats. Right? So that's formalizing the lead process, the lead response process that's testing the offer, testing landing pages. There's that level of testing that that would happen on the Google side. And really there's two there's two big things that need to happen. The first is it's fixing speed to lead. And this is where CRM automation comes into play and AI comes into play. So it's getting all of the automation setu

p, getting the conversational AI setup so that these systems can work. And to get those systems set up, it's really a process of digitizing the company's soul, digitizing the brand, the brand voice, the mission, the SOPs, what's the process for qualifying a lead? What does it mean to be qualified? All of that gets digitized. And then we use that to train AI agents to be our customer service reps, to be our appointment setters, to be our follow up people. So that's one key piece of this. The other key piece is what is the funnel that's going to work? And really instead of thinking about funnels, we can think about this as what is the journey, the right of passage, if you will, for someone to become part of our community, to become a customer with us. And we need to choose a funnel. Right? And the funnel that I would choose is the interactive assessment funnel. And what that means is we would create tools that help people understand themselves better. So this would be like someone that has depression or someone that has some type of mental health issue. We'd create a tool that is not to help us qualify them as a lead, but to help them understand themselves better as a human. Things like, you know, why, you know, when you're feeling anxious, what do you do? Do you take a bath? Do you watch TV? Do you eat? Creating these interactive assessments that we then can help people put people into categories? I'd recommend packages, experiences based on that category. So I'd want to start with that optimization right there is creating this lead, this interactive assessment and getting our standing up our AI infrastructure. And what this is going to enable us to do is to capture more leads through the assessment and then to turn more leads into qualified appointments through AI. So AI can help us with the qualification and the appointment booking. Now that alone could be a 2x or a 3x increase in clients right there. So we'd want to do that first. And we would want to push Google 

spend up from that place and just see how much we can continue to push Google spend. Focused on that bottom of funnel direct response. Now as we, as our assess, we can also start to push up into the buyer's journey so that we're not just focusing on people that are ready for the sale. But we're focusing on people that are now in the two different phases of the buyer's journey. So we're not just focused on people ready for a sale or even beyond this. But we are pushing into yet deciding between providers, considering solutions. This would be let's take the burned out healer example. So people that are unaware of the problem, they're too high up. People that are aware of the problem. I think I have burnout or depression. I don't want to convince them yet. But can people that are considering solutions? So this is where I'd like to target people. So running, putting out content that speaks to these people on the channels that they are at. And for us, let's, I would just focus on one channel first. I don't want to focus beyond that because it can be, it's just going to be confusing. And that, that's another piece of what I've seen in high performing teams is they stick to one channel and one persona until they get it, they get it figured out. A losing recipe is trying to target all six personas across six channels. That's 36 combinations. That's way too many. There's no way to, to track that. There's no way that a human can track that. So we focus on one channel, one persona. And we figure that out. We unlock that and we can unlock that towards profitability. And there's plenty of companies that have grown on one channel, have grown to three to five to 10 million on one channel. So there shouldn't be a problem for us to do that either, especially looking at ketamine. So that, that will be, that's what I would do. First is focus on those. Now, some of these other things are pretty interesting. On the content and SEO side, content SEO are changing fundamentally. And what w

e need to think about is really distribution. Like we have AI that can write really great mediocre posts. Anyone has access to that tool. So the, the currency of content is, is changing. It's the first piece and it's more personal. It's more, it's ultimately more human, which means it's more personal. It's more vulnerable. It's more forced, first person, first person story. It's building in public. It's sharing failures. So that's, that's one piece of the puzzle. The other piece is we need to think about distribution and how we're engaging with our audiences. So algorithm changes on Google can wipe out traffic or social media changes can also wipe out traffic. What I would like to do is focus on owned audiences. And that would be going with a newsletter first approach. So it would be focusing on what, which persona are we going to serve first? What is the content that we, that's going to serve them based on what stage they're in? And then would start creating that content. And creating that content inside of a, a newsletter container to say, Hey, if you are, you know, a burned out healer, here is a newsletter that talks about mental health for people that work in mental health, or mental health for healers. And start to give people the stories that they're already looking for to help them understand themselves better based on where they're at in the funnel, in that buyer's journey. Something like 10 morning signs of healthcare worker burnout. That's unaware. But healthcare worker depression, you know, all of these are types of, types of content that I would publish inside this newsletter using AI as tools as a tool to help, help get that going. And I think it's important to start with newsletters first, versus with blog posts because we get to own that audience. There's higher engagement. There's higher trust. We also get direct feedback from our newsletter on what people care about, right? The newsletter then becomes a place for content R&D. And then we can use tha

t content R&D and everything else that we ship in the higher touch things that we ship, you know, videos, for instance. For care provider referrals, I don't want to prioritize this one too fast. At this stage, I think care provider referrals is ultimately just choosing the right persona to work with. It's choosing to work with providers and getting them to experience this firsthand. So in the first year, there is no, there is no organized effort to get care provider referrals. We are planting the seed in the ground and there's an organized effort to work with care providers to get care providers into the ecosystem and experiencing this firsthand. And if referrals come out of that then great. But if not, that's also great because we're building the relationship, we're building the trust with providers first. And that would ultimately be who I who I prioritize in the growth strategy would be the burned out healers because it plants that care provider referral seed. get care providers into the ecosystem and experiencing this first hand. And that would ultimately be who I prioritize in the growth strategy would be the burned out healers because it plants that care provider referral seed. We can start to create the community around those people, create content around that persona. And with that the referrals will just come organically because these people trust us. For partnerships and affiliates, I would change that to be partnerships and earned media. I've spoken about this already but really for partnerships and earned media, I think the value, the leveraged value is just in having the logo on the website. It's not in the direct traffic that's going to come from that because unless this is a featured post on someone's homepage, we're not going to get traffic. There's not going to be any organic traffic from this. And this is a place like I've worked with brands, we've commissioned articles from Forbes, we've paid money for these types of placements and they don't get 

organic traffic. Just because they came from Forbes doesn't give it organic traffic. What it does do though is it allows you to put Forbes's logo on your website which rises the water for everything else. Just having that Forbes logo is going to help your conversion rate on every other channel because Forbes is a trusted logo. If someone was to click on that Forbes logo and then go to the article, they're going to be like, oh wow, Forbes really did do an article on this and Forbes is saying they trust it and I trust Forbes. So therefore, this is a legit company. So it's focusing on partnerships that are going to help increase the conversion rate across the entire company by building trust signals. Now the other piece of this is influencers and affiliates. This is where we are actually focusing on sales, not on trust building because influencers and affiliates, they have an audience. And ultimately we're just paying to rent their audience. And I have, I put together a plan on how we can use influencers and affiliates to, we would just do a content creator based fam trip. And that's going to get us content to launch meta. So in this first 12 months, I think we can scale Google without needing to launch meta. But if we did want to launch meta, then the go-to-market plan for meta would be to launch this fam trip first. And this fam trip is going to get us a bunch of content created by content creators, influencers. It's going to get us the return, ideally the initial return on that money because we are having the influencers posted into their communities. Right, and these communities already trust this influencer. So if the influencer had the experience, it was transformational, they post about it in their communities. Their communities might have similar issues. And now they're coming to us for the same transformational experience. So we're getting the connection to a new audience, we're getting direct sales, and then we're getting all this content that we can continue

 to use in our paid social marketing. So until we're confident with the Google side, that we've done everything we need to do on the Google side, which remember is building the quiz, getting the CRM automation going, doing those landing pages and offer tests, ramping spend on Google. Once we're confident that we've hit the ceiling there, that's when we'd go and start to turn on this other channel, which would be meta, and we would do that with influencers and affiliates. And really the difference between an influencer and an affiliate is just the deal structure. So if we are trading or paying money, it's an influencer. If we're doing it on a commission basis, then it's an affiliate. That's the only difference. For community engagement, this is a really interesting one. This is something that is personally very close to my heart because it's what I've been building already. At the womb, we have. It is a community. I've worked in 30 community projects over the past decade, co-living community projects, and in my own experience with medicine, I went into a deep spiritual crisis about two years ago, and didn't know where to go. I didn't have an integration community around me. I had a lot of facilitator friends and therapist friends, but it wasn't what I wanted. And so I ended up creating this thing called the Deep Dark Library, which was a community storytelling event where we gathered in person to talk about the things that were too big for us to carry on our own. It was functionally an integration community that spanned across medicine work, right, to passage work. Grief work, transitions. When we had themed events where people would come, we did one on love, we did one on grief and death, we did one on spirituality and psychedelics, we did one on money and purpose, we did one on community and family. And all of that was. it was their powerful events, their in-person events, and it was the start to what I'm working on as my side project is the Deep Dark Library, this

 card version of that, to ultimately help these conversations happen more, and to build this integration community, this community of people that are doing transformational work, that are acknowledging that they aren't where they want to be. They're acknowledging where they are and where they want to be, and then doing the hard work to actually get to there. And the community engagement piece, this is where I see a whole other business, this is a whole other business, a whole other business model, but there's a ton of juice in building this integration community. I could riff on this for hours and hours on what this would look like, but I do just want to share, I built my own community, a co-living community, I built the community around that, I built the Deep Dark Library community, I built 30 other co-living communities, so I understand that community is a big part of this, and I have deep, deep experience in this community. And I literally just don't have enough time to talk about. I've been working on this, this was my. if I don't do this, then I'm going to be building this integration community called Rehuman, which ultimately is acknowledging that we are all in this process of rehumaning, and that to rehuman we need a catalyst experience, which is a truth-seeking experience. Medicine work is one way to do that, right? To passage work is another way, there's some unintentional catalyst experiences, like death, divorce, heartbreak, that can also be catalyst experiences to help us see the truth of ourselves and our situations, and then the integration piece being both the nurture, the more feminine side, and the accountability, the more masculine side, and having those structures in your life to help remind you of your truth. And to help hold you in living that truth and becoming the person you want to be, and that comes in the form of things like the Deep Dark Library, therapy, coaching, it is a continuous integration community. Okay, those are the growth ideas.

 I mentioned the first year, your game plan, the priorities would be ultimately choosing the persona, scaling Google by the assessment, by building the interactive assessment, building out the CRM and AI infrastructure, and the ways that have outlined, and then doing the landing page and the offer testing, and that rolls up into like Google testing, so now we're testing not just bottom of funnel keywords, we're testing depression, quiz, keywords, or healthcare burnout, healthcare worker burnout, keywords, and we're trying to drive people into doing this as a solution. So, I think that's the best way to get the assessment to get information about themselves, and to start building trust and offering free value to them, and then to having our AI infrastructure qualify them, and then to get them booked to talk to a transformational coach, or whatever we want to call it. So, we're getting to profitability, after that it's then turning on Facebook, using this influencer and earned media strategy, the partnerships and affiliates, we can throw that in there, you know, getting three tier one publishers on Facebook, them booked to talk to a transformational coach or whatever we want to call it. That's the first year getting to profitability. After that, it's then turning on Facebook using this influencer and earned media strategy. The partnerships and affiliates, we can throw that in there, you know, getting three tier one publishers on getting articles from three tier one publishers is more a question of the time and money we want to invest into it. It's about $7,500 to $15,000 to get a placement with a tier one publisher. So if we wanted to get, you know, between three, you know, three and five of them, then we can just do the math on do we have that investment or not. The care provider referrals, ultimately, that's just choosing the right persona and it's planting the seeds right now. And then the content piece is still just choosing the right persona using the newsletter 

as a testing grounds for the content. So we are using our persona and where they're at in the buyer's journey to decide what content we're pushing out. And then we're using the newsletter to test that content. How is it performing? And then based on how it's performing, we're taking the best content from the newsletter and then chopping that up and distributing it across all the different platforms that we could. For some of those platforms, it requires more investment. You know, if we have to take an article and then turn that into a long format video, the long format video is going to take more time and money to produce. We can hedge that risk by trying out five newsletter concepts and then choosing the newsletter concept that performed the best. And now we have four R target persona, which we're cultivating our newsletter right in our community. We're starting to build that community in our newsletter. We can understand how it tests in the newsletter. And then put resources to what's working well for that persona and to put resources into building the content for other platforms. Right? And that could be social platforms like Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, video base or even YouTube or run if we run YouTube ads or it could be more of the text-based platforms like X or LinkedIn or Medium. All of this is really about distribution. All the channels are about distribution. So that's what the first year would look like. We measure success is ultimately we measure success based on profitability. And until we're at comfortable profitability, that's what we're moving towards. And we're moving towards building freedom and we get freedom through profitability. So in I would rather take on money to fuel growth because we know we have a system that works. That's going to be an easy place for us to raise more money. And if we get to a point where we need to grow faster than somebody else, then we should. At this point, Odyssey is already the number one player. Taking on more in

vestment to keep the company afloat, I don't want to do that. I want to take the lead, the money, the team and move all of that as fast as possible to profitability. And then from that place of grounded profitability, then be able to make smart decisions on what's next. The metrics on how we measure profitability have all been outlined in the Google sheet. This is a lead-based business. So we can think about that in a couple of different ways based on the sole of the company. But we do ultimately need to. The funnel is we get leads. We qualify those leads, those leads book an appointment, and we sell them into a package. This is just the buyer's journey. We can frame all of this in a community-based way. And that's at the heart of this is we're not just like spamming people. We are creating content that is resident for where someone is at in their journey. Right? We're choosing the persona. We're choosing the buyer's journey that we want to target. We're creating content to help people understand themselves better. To help people find us. We're using the distribution channels to help people find us with content that's going to help them understand themselves better. We're using the interactive assessment to get people into our ecosystem, to give them to do a micro to have a micro commitment to us, for us to show them the value that we bring before they even work with us. Using this tool as leverage to help personalize and help continue to help them understand themselves and how this work can support them in their journey. AI is helping qualify and book appointments. And then we are running a transformational coaching call with them to talk about their particular pains and why it's taken them so long to get to where they are. And using any PQ sales, which is very similar motivational selling, to get people to see the truth of their situation and then getting a commitment from them to change. And that commitment comes in the form of a deposit on a transformational exp

erience. It happens after that. That's where there's opportunity to build the integration community. And that integration community is where we get to, you know, start to build more trust, referrals, testimonials. And you know, I could see that happening, the community build part, just being continued integration. But we just, we call it something better. I think we just use something like the deep dark library where it is not, I don't know what's happening in integration sessions now. But what works about the library is ultimately that there's not really a leader. We're all coming as equals and we're all responsible for holding the container. It's in small groups. It's story-based. There's no judgment. There's really clear rules. So I think it could just be launching something like, you know, the library and that just merging with this. And with that, I want to leave this whole conversation with the following. I'm at a place in my life where I, I'm not going to work for somebody else. I'm going to work in partnership and collaboration. And I need to, I need to be an owner in, I'm only building things that I own at this point. I need to be an owner. I need to be an equal. I need to come at this as, you know, the merging. I don't want to have a side project. I don't want to secretly be working on, on rehuman, the library. I want to bring all of that and merge it with everything that you already have to, you know, create something that's revolutionary. And that's my framing for this is, I'm bringing everything that I have, which includes my, some of my own IP, my community building, the library, the rehuman, the conceptualization around that, sacred commerce, O'Coco. And I am wanting to, I don't want to have, I don't want to have a side project. And to be able to do that, I need to have, you know, real ownership at a, at a founder level. And to have real accountability and autonomy at a founder level, it needs to be my company. If it's not my company, I'm not going to

 stay. And I, and I know that to be true. So for it to be my company, it needs to have my ideas, my passions need to be infused into it. And there needs to be no difference between me working on rehuman or me working on this or me working on the library and me working on this. It needs to all be, be one unified offer. And that's how I'm approaching this, because I don't want to have any, I don't want to have a side project. I've been working on the library and rehuman for the last three years in various capacities. And they are ready to be birthed, they're ready to be collaborated. So this is, this is, this is how I'm approaching all of this is, I'm not going to work as an employee, I'll be, I'll be a co-founder and a co-owner and a teammate in, in all of it. But if it can't be that, then I have to say no, because I know that I'll continue to get pulled back to rehuman into the library. for the last three years in various capacities and they are ready to be birthed, they're ready to be collaborated. So this is how I'm approaching all of this is I'm not going to work as an employee, I'll be a co-founder and a co-owner and a teammate in all of it but if it can't be that then I have to say no because I know that I'll continue to get pulled back to rehuman into the library.
