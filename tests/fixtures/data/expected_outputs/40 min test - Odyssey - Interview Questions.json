  "transcript": "Now that I've gotten to sit with it for about a week I want to revisit the\n12-month growth strategy and you know before I even get in to answering the\nquestions in this document I want to ground it into my experience working with\nalmost two dozen startups in the health and wellness space across in-house and\nagency roles and want to communicate some of the wisdom that I carry in seeing\nwhat successful companies do and how successful companies, successful CEOs and\nleaders of companies approach things and it all revolves around money in kind of\ntwo ways. The first is in how we are monetized by others and the second is in\nhow we monetize ourselves. So let's break that down. We are monetized by\nothers when we are not in control of our fate. So if we're creating a company\nthat is not sustainable that's not profitable then we have to bring in\noutside money and or we have to make compromises in our decision making and we\nhave to start to prioritize what's going to actually make us money so that we\ndon't quite a business versus how can we serve our mission and our customers\nthe best? How can we create value which then flows back to us? That's the\nquestion that's where we want to be is to be able to answer those types of\nquestions and what can happen is if we take on money from investors they can\nforce our hand to monetize before we're ready or they can shape the the\nsoul of our company in ways that don't resonate with our mission and who we're\ntrying to serve. The other way that we can monetize ourselves is by operating\nfrom that place of fear. Oh we're afraid of going out of business so we're gonna\nmake decisions that optimize for making money versus optimize for serving our\ncustomers and our mission. So in both of those cases it's really important to\nget to a place of sustainability of profitability as soon as possible and this\nis something that I've experienced personally in building the womb my my\ncommunity co-living and bathhouse project and I had limited funds I spent I\nwas strategic around why I bought the property I did because I know that I\ncould run both a co-living business and a bathhouse business. I really wanted to\ndo the bathhouse business and the community was the hedge and it was a good\nhedge because I ended up running out of money for the bathhouse. The utility\ncosts I had never done a big real estate project before there was unknown\nunknowns one of them was utility costs and utilities being ended up being way\nmore than I could afford so we got a really beautiful sauna some rustic old\ncold plunge tubs but no hot tub no beautiful landscaping or lights or you know\nthe the true vision of what I wanted didn't didn't manifest and yet it's\nstill a beautiful bathhouse just not bringing in money as I as I had hoped it\nwould but the co-living community is and it was very important to get to that\nplace of profitability so that there's breathing room so that I'm not\nbleeding money into this project every month. So with that I just want to I want\nto preface with that because I've seen companies focus on the wrong things too\nearly specifically focusing on building brand or building community before\nbuilding profitability and at this stage of company this is my this is my\nniche I know that this this stage and this niche is what I've been working with\nfor the entirety of my career and you know people like Robbie Bent of\nother ship they you know he he wasn't focused on building a really sexy brand\nhe was focused on solving people's problems on understanding how to get\npeople into a space and and building partnerships to do that and ultimately got\nto a place of you know he launched in his backyard he launched in his back\nyard figured out how to get people excited about it then he built a 200\nthousand dollar concept in his garage and then got that to profitability and\nthen put his own some of his own money into doing the first concept got that\nincredible profitability and then raised money to it to scale right so he's\nalways been about profitability and owning it owning his future versus I've\nseen someone like a company like Parable was a brain supplement company they\nalso raised two million dollars they raised two million dollars from PepsiCo\nfor their for their seed round and they spent it on doing a you know a hundred\nthousand dollar plus research study with a double-blind experience to try to\nprove the the effectiveness of this of their brain supplement and they spent a\nbunch of money on hiring a really sick brand agency so that they had a really\nsexy landing page and then they hired me you know one of the most expensive\nme a growth ahead of growth from one of the most expensive agencies Winston\nFrancois to lead their growth but they weren't ever focused on unit\neconomics they weren't focused on solving problems they were focused on trying\nto be a sexy brand and be sexy founders and beyond you know get cover pieces\nand they went out of business because they they weren't solving a real problem\nso that's that's just you know the tale of two stories and at a company like\nOdyssey really I think we first need to look at who we're serving where the\ncurrent customers at and why are they why are they coming to Odyssey right now\nand we know that there's retirees that there are business leaders and that\nthere are health care providers and those are all very different customer\npersonas and they have different needs right and so the first the first piece\nis just getting clear on who are the personas that we're reaching and I have\nsome examples of what do these personas look like what are the pain points\nhow do they behave what are the questions that they have at different stages of\nthe buyer's journey and this buyer's journey is one of the core the core\npieces of how we reach people because the buyer's journey is it dictates\nreally the persona and where they're at in the buyer's journey that dictates the\nmessages that we that we put out the content that we put out so if we wanted to\ngo with this persona at this stage you know to get people into this stage then\nwe would be putting out content that answers you know these types of\nquestions\nit'd be content like this\nthat's showing up in these types of actions so that's the first piece is\ngetting clear on the persona and where we're targeting in the buyer's\njourney the second piece is then understanding\nhow do we get to profitability how do we get to freedom as soon as possible\nbecause once we're profitable we are not beholden to anyone else we can make\nour own decisions we're free we're free to do what is best for our community\nand for our our mission so that really is the priority that I see is getting\nto profitability and I'd like to do that as soon as possible and that's going\nto dictate what channel we choose first so we already know that Google is the\nchannel that's providing the most leads and the most clients and that would be\nthe first channel to prioritize is that's going to go at the top of this list\nbecause we know it's working and the easiest way to get to profitability is\ngoing to be to test what's work to can to lean into what's already working so on\nthe Google side right now there's a lot of ad that are targeting bottom of\nfunnel direct response psilocybin retreats so we want to first use what's\nalready working in that that place and make it work better right so that's\nformalizing the lead process the lead response process that's testing the\noffer testing landing pages\n\nThere's that level of testing that would happen on the Google side.\nAnd really there's two big things that need to happen.\nThe first is it's fixing speed to lead.\nAnd this is where CRM automation comes into play and AI comes into play.\nSo it's getting all of the automation set up, getting the conversational AI set up so\nthat these systems can work.\nTo get those systems set up, it's really a process of digitizing the company's soul.\nDigitizing the brand, the brand voice, the mission, the SOPs.\nWhat's the process for qualifying a lead?\nWhat does it mean to be qualified?\nAll of that gets digitized.\nAnd then we use that to train AI agents to be our customer service reps,\nto be our appointment setters, to be our follow-up people.\nSo that's one key piece of this.\nThe other key piece is, what is the funnel that's going to work?\nAnd really, instead of thinking about funnels, we can think about this as,\nwhat is the journey, the right of passage, if you will,\nfor someone to become part of our community, to become a customer with us?\nAnd we need to choose a funnel, right?\nAnd the funnel that I would choose is the interactive assessment funnel.\nAnd what that means is we would create tools that help people understand themselves better.\nSo this would be like someone that has depression or someone that,\nyou know, has some type of mental health issue.\nWe'd create a tool that is not to help us qualify them as a lead,\nbut to help them understand themselves better as a human.\nThings like, you know, when you're feeling anxious, what do you do?\nDo you take a bath, do you watch TV, do you eat?\nCreating these interactive assessments that we then can help people,\nput people in two categories, and recommend packages, experiences,\nbased on that category.\nSo I'd want to start with that optimization right there,\nis creating this lead, this interactive assessment,\nand getting our standing up our AI infrastructure.\nAnd what this is going to enable us to do is to capture more leads through the assessment,\nand then to turn more leads into qualified appointments through AI.\nSo AI can help us with the qualification and the appointment booking.\nNow that alone could be a 2X or a 3X increase in clients right there.\nSo we'd want to do that first.\nAnd we would want to push Google spend up from that place,\nand just see how much we can continue to push Google spend,\nfocused on that bottom of funnel direct response.\nNow as we, as our assess, we can also start to push up into the buyer's journey,\nso that we're not just focusing on people that are ready for the sale,\nbut we're focusing on people that are now in the two different phases of the buyer's journey.\nSo we're not just focused on people ready for a sale, or even beyond this.\nBut we are pushing into yet deciding between providers, considering solutions.\nAnd this would be, let's take the burned out healer example, right?\nSo people that are unaware of the problem, they're too high up.\nPeople that are aware of the problem, I think I have burnt out our depression.\nI don't want to convince them yet, but can people that are considering solutions?\nSo this is where I'd like to target people, right?\nSo running, putting out content that speaks to these people on the channels that they are at.\nAnd for us, let's, I would just focus on one channel first.\nI don't want to focus beyond that, because it can be, it's just going to be confusing.\nAnd that, that's another piece of what I've seen in high performing teams.\nThey stick to one channel and one persona until they get it figured out.\nA losing recipe is trying to target all six personas across six channels.\nThat's 36 combinations.\nThat's way too many.\nThere's no way to track that.\nThere's no way that a human can track that.\nSo we focus on one channel, one persona.\nAnd we figure that out, we unlock that, and we can unlock that towards profitability.\nAnd there's plenty of companies that have grown on one channel, have grown to three to five to ten million\non one channel.\nSo there shouldn't be a problem for us to do that either, especially looking at ketamine.\nSo that, that will be, that's what I would do.\nFirst is focus on those.\nNow, some of these other things are pretty interesting.\nOn the content and SEO side, content SEO are changing fundamentally.\nAnd what we need to think about is really distribution.\nWe have AI that can write really great mediocre posts.\nAnd anyone has access to that tool.\nSo the currency of content is changing.\nIt's the first piece.\nAnd it's more personal.\nIt's more, it's ultimately more human, which means it's more personal.\nIt's more vulnerable.\nIt's more first person story.\nIt's building in public.\nIt's sharing failures.\nSo that's one piece of the puzzle.\nThe other piece is we need to think about distribution and how we're engaging with our\naudiences.\nSo algorithm changes on Google can wipe out traffic or social media changes can also wipe\nout traffic.\nWhat I would like to do is focus on owned audiences.\nAnd that would be going with a newsletter first approach.\nSo it would be focusing on, which persona are we going to serve first?\nWhat is the content that's going to serve them based on what stage they're in?\nAnd then we'd start creating that content and creating that content inside of a newsletter\ncontainer to say, hey, if you are a burned out healer, here is a newsletter that talks\nabout mental health for people that work in mental health or mental health for healers.\nAnd start to give people the stories that they're already looking for to help them understand\nthemselves better based on where they're at in the funnel, in that buyer's journey.\nThat's something like 10 morning signs of health care worker burnout, so that's unaware.\nBut health care worker depression, you know, all of these are types of content that I would\npublish inside this newsletter using AI as tools as a tool to help get that going.\nAnd I think it's important to start with newsletters first versus with blog posts because we get\nto own that audience.\nThere's higher engagement.\nThere's higher trust.\nWe also get direct feedback from our newsletter on what people care about, right?\nThe newsletter then becomes a place for content R&D, and then we can use that content\nR&D and everything else that we ship in the higher touch things that we ship, you know,\nvideos, for instance.\nFor care provider referrals, I don't want to prioritize this one too fast.\nAt this stage, I think care provider referrals is ultimately just choosing the right persona\nto work with.\nIt's choosing to work with providers and getting them to experience this first hand.\nSo in the first year, there is no organized effort to get care provider referrals.\nWe are planting the seed in the ground and there's an organized effort to work with care\nproviders to get care providers into the ecosystem and experiencing this first hand.\nAnd if referrals come out of that then great.\nBut if not, that's also great because we're building the relationship, we're building\nthe trust with providers first.\nAnd that would ultimately be who I prioritize in the growth strategy would be the burned\nout healers because it plants that care provider referral seed.\nWe can start to create the community around those people, create content around that\npersona.\nAnd with that, the referrals will just come organically because these people trust us.\nFor partnerships and affiliates, I would change that to be partnerships and earned media.\nI've spoken about this already, but really, for partnerships and earned media, I think\nthe value.\n\nThe leveraged value is just in having the logo on the website.\nIt's not in the direct traffic that's going to come from that.\nBecause unless this is a featured post on someone's homepage,\nwe're not going to get traffic. There's not going to be any organic traffic from this.\nAnd this is a place like I've worked with brands. We've commissioned articles from Forbes.\nWe've paid money for these types of placements.\nAnd they don't get organic traffic.\nJust because they came from Forbes doesn't give it organic traffic.\nWhat it does do though is it allows you to put Forbes's logo on your website,\nwhich rises the water for everything else.\nJust having that Forbes logo is going to help your conversion rate\non every other channel because Forbes is a trusted logo.\nAnd if someone was to click on that Forbes logo and then go to the article,\nthey're going to be like, oh wow, Forbes really did do an article on this.\nAnd Forbes is saying they trust it and I trust Forbes.\nSo therefore, this is a legit company.\nSo it's focusing on partnerships that are going to help increase the conversion rate\nacross the entire company by building trust signals.\nNow the other piece of this is influencers and affiliates.\nThis is where we are actually focusing on sales, not on trust building\nbecause influencers and affiliates, they have an audience.\nAnd ultimately we're just paying to rent their audience.\nAnd I have, I put together a plan on how we can use influencers and affiliates\nto we would just do a content creator-based fan trip.\nAnd that's going to get us content to launch to launch meta.\nSo in this first 12 months, I think we can scale Google without needing to launch meta.\nBut if we did want to launch meta, then the go-to-market plan for meta\nwould be to launch this fan trip first.\nAnd this fan trip is going to get us a bunch of content created by content creators, influencers.\nIt's going to get us the return, ideally the initial return on that money\nbecause we are having the influencers posted into their communities.\nRight, and these communities already trust this influencer.\nSo if the influencer had the experience, it was transformational.\nThey post about it in their communities.\nTheir communities might have similar issues.\nAnd now they're coming to us for the same transformational experience.\nSo we're getting the connection to a new audience.\nWe're getting direct sales.\nAnd then we're getting all this content that we can continue to use in our paid social marketing.\nSo until we're confident with the Google side\nthat we've done everything we need to do on the Google side, which remember is\nbuilding the quiz, getting the CRM automation going,\ndoing those landing page and offer tests, ramping spend on Google.\nOnce we're confident that we've hit the ceiling there,\nthat's when we'd go and start to turn on this other channel, which would be meta.\nAnd we would do that with influencers and affiliates.\nAnd really the difference between an influencer and an affiliate is just the deal structure.\nSo if we are trading or paying money, it's an influencer.\nIf we're doing it on a commission basis, then it's an affiliate.\nThat's the only difference.\nFor community engagement, this is a really interesting one.\nThis is something that is personally very close to my heart\nbecause it's what I've been building already.\nAt the womb, we have...\nIt is a community.\nI've built the community.\nI've worked in 30 community projects over the past decade.\nColiving community projects.\nAnd in my own experience with medicine,\nI went into a deep spiritual crisis about two years ago\nand didn't know where to go.\nI didn't have an integration community around me.\nI had a lot of facilitator friends and therapist friends,\nbut it wasn't what I wanted.\nAnd so I ended up creating this thing called the Deep Dark Library,\nwhich was a community storytelling event\nwhere we gathered in person to talk about the things\nthat were too big for us to carry on our own.\nIt was functionally an integration community that spanned across\nmedicine work, rights of passage work, grief work, transitions.\nWhen we had themed events where people would come,\nwe did one on love, we did one on grief and death,\nwe did one on spirituality and psychedelics,\nwe did one on money and purpose, we did one on community and family.\nAnd all of that was...\nIt was their powerful events.\nThey were in-person events.\nAnd it was the start to what I'm working on as my side project\nis the Deep Dark Library, this card version of that,\nto ultimately help these conversations happen more,\nand to build this integration community,\nthis community of people that are doing transformational work,\nthat are acknowledging that they aren't where they want to be,\nthey're acknowledging where they are, and where they want to be,\nand then doing the hard work to actually get to there.\nAnd the community engagement piece,\nthis is where I see a whole nother business.\nThis is a whole nother business, a whole nother business model.\nBut there's a ton of juice in building this integration community.\nAnd I will...\nI could riff on this for hours and hours on what this would look like.\nBut I do just want to share, I built my own community,\na co-loving community, I built the community around that,\nI built the Deep Dark Library community,\nI built 30 other co-loving communities,\nso I understand that community is a big part of this,\nand I have deep, deep experience in this,\nand I literally just don't have enough time to talk about.\nI've been working on this, this was my...\nIf I don't do this, then I'm going to be building this integration community,\ncalled Rehuman, which ultimately is acknowledging that we are all\non this process of rehumaning,\nand that to rehuman we need a catalyst experience,\nwhich is a truth-seeking experience.\nMedicine work is one way to do that,\nright, to passage work is another way.\nThere's some unintentional catalyst experiences,\nlike death, divorce, heartbreak,\nthat can also be catalyst experiences to help us see the truth of ourselves\nand our situations,\nand then the integration piece being both the nurture,\nthe more feminine inside,\nand the accountability, the more masculine inside,\nand having those structures in your life\nto help remind you of your truth,\nand to help hold you in living that truth,\nin becoming the person you want to be,\nand that comes in the form of things like the Deep Dark Library,\ntherapy, coaching,\nit is in a continuous integration community.\nOkay, those are the growth ideas.\nI mentioned the first year game plan.\nThe priorities would be ultimately choosing the persona,\nscaling Google by the assessment,\nby building the interactive assessment,\nbuilding out the CRM and AI infrastructure,\nand the ways that have outlined,\nand then doing the landing page\nand the offer testing,\nand that rolls up into like Google testing.\nSo now we're testing not just bottom of funnel keywords,\nwe're testing depression, quiz,\nkeywords, or healthcare burnout,\nhealthcare worker burnout,\nkeywords, and we're trying to drive people\ninto doing this assessment,\nto get information about themselves,\nto start building trust and offering free value to them,\nand then to having our AI infrastructure qualify them,\nand then to get them booked to talk to a transformational coach,\nor whatever we want to call it.\nThat's the first year getting to profitability.\nAfter that, it's then turning on Facebook,\nusing this influencer and earned media strategy.\nThe partnerships and affiliates,\nwe can throw that in there,\ngetting three tier one publishers\non getting articles from three tier one publishers\nis more a question of the time and money.\nWe want to invest into it.\nIt's about $7,500 to $15,000 to get a placement\nwith a tier one publisher.\nSo if we wanted to get between three\nand five of them, then we can just do the math\non do we have that investment or not?\nThe care provider referrals,\nultimately, that's just choosing the right persona,\nand it's planting the seeds right now,\nand then the content piece is still just choosing the right persona,\nusing the newsletter as testing grounds for the content.\nSo we are using our persona\nand where they're at in the buyer's journey\nto decide what content we're pushing out,\nand then we're using the newsletter to test that content,\nhow is it performing,\nand then based on how it's performing,\nwe're taking the best content.\n\nfrom the newsletter and then chopping that up and distributing it across all the different platforms\nthat we could. For some of those platforms, it requires more investment. You know, we have to take\nan article and then turn that into a long format video. The long format video is going to take\nmore time and money to produce, but we can hedge that risk by, you know, trying out five newsletter\nconcepts and then choosing the newsletter concept that performed the best. And now we have, you know,\nfor our target persona, which we're cultivating our newsletter right in our community, right? We're\nstarting to build that community in our newsletter. We can understand how it tests in the newsletter\nand then put resources to what's working well for that persona and to put resources into building\nthe content for other platforms, right? And that could be social platforms like Instagram, Facebook,\nTikTok, video base or even YouTube or run if we run YouTube ads or it could be more of the\ntext-based platforms like X or LinkedIn or Medium. All of this is really about distribution. All\nthe channels are about distribution. So that's what the first year would look like.\nWe measure success is ultimately, we measure success based on profitability and until we're at\ncomfortable profitability, that's what we're moving towards. We're moving towards building\nfreedom and we get freedom through profitability. So in, I would rather take on money to fuel growth\nbecause we know we have a system that works. That's going to be an easy place for us to raise more\nmoney and if we get to a point where we need to grow faster than somebody else, then we should.\nAt this point, Odyssey is already the number one player.\nTaking on more investment to keep the company afloat, I don't want to do that.\nI want to take the lead, the money, the team and move all of that as fast as possible to profitability\nand then from that place of grounded profitability, then be able to make smart decisions on what's\nnext. The metrics on how we measure profitability have all been outlined in the Google Sheet.\nThis is a lead-based business. So we can think about that in a couple of different ways based on\non the soul of the company. But we do ultimately need to\nlike the funnel is we get leads, we qualify those leads, those leads book an appointment,\nand we sell them into a package. This is just the buyer's journey. We can frame all of this\nin a community-based way and that's at the heart of this is we're not just like\nspamming people. We are creating content that is is resonant for where someone is at in their\njourney. We are, right, we're choosing the persona, we're choosing the buyer's journey that we\nwant to target. We're creating content to help people understand themselves better, to help people\nfind, to find us. We're using the distribution channels to help people find us with content that's\ngoing to help them understand themselves better. We're using the interactive assessment to\nget people into our ecosystem to give to give to get them to do a micro to have a micro commitment\nto us for us to show them the value that we bring before they even work with us using this\ntool as leverage to help personalize and help continue to help them understand themselves and how\nthis work can support them in their journey. AI is helping qualify and book appointments\nand then we are running a transformational coaching call with with them to talk about their\nparticular pains and why it's taken them so long to get to where they are and using any PQ sales\nwhich is very similar motivational selling to get people to see the truth of their situation\nand then getting a commitment from them to change and that commitment comes in the form of a\ndeposit on a transformational experience. What happens after that? That's where there's\nopportunity to build the integration community and that integration community is where we get to\nstart to build more trust, referrals, testimonials and I could see that that happening the community\nbuild part just being continued integration but we call it something better. I think we just use\nsomething like the deep dark library where it is not I don't know what's happening in integration\nsessions now but what works about the library is ultimately that there's not really a leader\nwe're all coming as equals and we're all responsible for holding the container it's in small groups\nit's story-based there's no judgment there's really clear rules so I think it could just be launching\nsomething like you know the library and that just merging with with this and with with that\nI want to I want to leave this whole conversation with the following I'm at a place in my life where\nI I'm not going to work for somebody else I'm going to work in partnership and collaboration\nand I need to I need to be an owner and I'm only building things that I own at this point\nI need to be an owner I need to be an equal I need to come at this as you know the merging I don't\nwant to have a side project I don't want to secretly be working on on rehuman the library\nI want to bring all of that and merge it with everything that you already have to you know create\nsomething that's that's revolutionary and and that's my framing for this is I'm bringing everything\nthat I have which includes my some of my own IP my community building the library the rehuman\nthe conceptualization around that sacred commerce okoko and I am wanting to I don't want to have\nI don't want to have a side project and to be able to do that I need to have you know real\nownership at a at a founder level and to have real accountability and autonomy at a founder level\num it needs to be my company if it's not my company I'm not going to stay and I and I know\nthat to be true so for it to be my company it needs to have my ideas my passions need to be infused\ninto it and there needs to be no difference between me working on rehuman or me working on this\nor me working on the library and me working on this it needs to all be be one unified offer\nand and that's how I'm approaching this because I don't want to have any I don't want to have a\nside project I've been working on the library and rehuman for the last three years in various\ncapacities and they are ready to be birthed they're ready to be collaborated so this this is\nthis is how I'm approaching all of this is I'm not going to work as an employee I'll be a\nI'll be a co-founder and a co-owner and a teammate in in all of it but if it can't be that\nthen I have to say no because I know that I'll continue to get pulled back to rehuman into the library",
